======== Milestone 3 ========
Hi Lotus! So the problem with parsing html is a little control flow bug,
the async calls seem to work but they're a nightmare to debug...

So if we don't need to do that that would be awesome,
I'm gonna try to just force the program to wait a couple milliseconds
It's a dirty hack but probably will work, then we can figure out the queries etc.

Other thing to do is modify the save method to accept a Room[] (from processHTML)
This could be called inside processHTML() or,
We could write a new method that just calls processHTML() on the data and calls save
(This might be nice because then we can handle the response codes in this new method and not change processHTML() at all)
